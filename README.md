This repository contains the official implementation of the paper:

**"Automated Security-Centric Refactoring of PowerShell Commands Using Large Language Models: A Python-Based Framework for Cross-Language Automation"**  
*Tamer Bahgat Elserwy, Basma E. El-Demerdash*  

The framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), static analysis, and secure execution wrappers to refactor PowerShell commands into safe, parameterized Python orchestration code while preserving functionality and mitigating vulnerabilities.
